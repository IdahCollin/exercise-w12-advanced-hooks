# Poetry in Motion - A Themed Poem Display with useLayoutEffect

This week, let's practice using the `useLayoutEffect` hook in our `App.jsx` file.

We will play with two themes, "light" and "dark", and each theme will have its own poem. Your job is to make a button that lets users switch between these themes. Changing the theme will also change the poem and the look of the page. This exercise will help you get better at choosing what to show based on the state, using React hooks to manage state, dealing with events, and using `useLayoutEffect` to handle side effects within the DOM layout :).

Letâ€™s have fun coding!

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server:

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
